## Recreating M1 Demo Video

If one would like to recreate the part about adding a climbing photo to their account, we have provided a link to an example photo through GDrive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlhy6667g_nZPCeNrXDc7iNQTTiHw7iX/view?usp=sharing

The photo is also available in the team-jambon folder on GDrive.


## Running the Project for M2

In order to run the project for the M2 release. One will need to download the ElasticSearch zip file located in the GDrive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KzKEqVVi7UrvVJ4Wvtu7WAIWXiyyoUZi/view?usp=sharing

After unzipping the file, one should open a terminal and cd into it. After doing that, run the command:
'./bin/elasticsearch'

This should start the ElasticSearch server needed to run the project. The terminal should generate a bunch of text with the name of your computer on many lines. This means that the server has been started properly. Leave this terminal open and then proceed with the standard instructions for cloning and setting up a Rails project in a separate terminal. Should you run into an error, then it should be fixed by restarting the ElasticSearch server.
